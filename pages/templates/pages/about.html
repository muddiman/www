  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I am a hydraulic modeling engineer and have been practicing for the past 15 years. I have a B.S. degree in Chemistry
  from New York University, where I also obtained a minor in Mathematics and Computer Science. I also have a B. Eng. degree
  in Chemical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, in Hoboken, NJ.
  I am currently employed at a large water utility where I develop computer models of water distributions systems and use these models 
  to design new distribution networks, size and select components and improve efficiency.
  My passion for programming stems from the age of eight (8), where I learned Applesoft BASIC on an Apple IIe computer.
  Fast forward to University, I took many courses where I learn pascal and C/C++ programming languages. I studied data structures 
  eg. linked lists and binary search trees.  I also studied algorithms (the big 'O' notation). 
  Since then I broaden my programming abilities by learning java, python, and HTML5 (ie. HTML, CSS & Javascript), along with a few frameworks.
  My projects include many websites, a bridge-like card game, a mental-abilities game, and extentions to the functionality of ArcGIS
  and Epanet.
  i also did some projects where i built electronic hardware and wrote the software for the Raspberry Pi (in python) and 
  the Arduino Uno (in C). 
  Currently I have no video tutorials on YouTube because I have a terrible voice that maybe very distracting. However,
  I intend to write very detailed tutorials and howto's about solving some of the more difficult problems I encounter, and whatever
  advance programming skills I master on this journey.
  Currently, I code for fun. This will change in the future because I love programming so much, such that it consumes most of my time.
  It may be best for me to focus on programming exclusively as a career.</p>
